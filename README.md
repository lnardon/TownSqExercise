I created this website as a technical interview for the company TownSquare. Below are the requirements given to me by the recruiter:

        Goal

        The goal of this exercise is to let you show your programming skills and knowledge
        via a Web App. The requirements are quite simple.

        Requirements
        ● Build a web application using a well-known front-end framework, it can be
        Angular, React, Vue, etc;
        ● Implement a scalable and clean architecture pattern;
        ● Use the following endpoints to GET the data (refer to
        http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com for more information):
            ○ http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
            ○ http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
        ● Create a list of posts, showing at least post title.
        ● When the user clicks a post, display a details screen with the user
        responsible for this post and full body;
        ● Create a way to edit a post, at least title and body (there's no PUT for
        that, just manipulate your local data).
